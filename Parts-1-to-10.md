Answered viewer questions, gave an overview of MSF and Meterpreter, and covered off what TLV packets look like. Shorter stream because of ANZAC day.

# Part 3 - 27 April 2019 @ 20:00 AEST

Spoke about dev issues such as permature optimsation, future proofing and more. Covered off some legality points, and spoke in depth about what we're going to do support multiple versions of the CLR.

# Part 4 - 29 April 2019 @ 20:00 AEST

Quickly recap'd stuff. Got started on project structure and wrote some awful, awful code. Good to get started though! Once we've figured out the vibe, we'll start moving faster.

# Part 5 - 1 may 2019 @ 20:00 AEST

Code! All the code. Got the TLV packet parsing first pass done. We can read TLV data from byte arrays and interact with the values.

# Part 6 - 3 may 2019 @ 20:00 AEST

More code this time! We did the deserialisation part of the TLV handling. So we should have "serder" done well enough to move up a level and start preparing the server in the next stream.

# Part 7 - 6 may 2019 @ 20:00 AEST

Rejigged some source structure, got started on parsing configuration coming from MSF during staging.

# Part 8 - 8 may 2019 @ 20:00 AEST

Finished configuration parsing, explored the staging process and got started on plugin management.

# Part 9 - 10 may 2019 @ 20:00 AEST

Add full HTTP transport parsing, started work on the server transport handling and packet dispatching.

# Part 10 - 13 may 2019 @ 20:00 AEST

Got started in building stages, stagers and MSF-related plumbing so that we can start testing the staging process of Meterp in the CLR.
