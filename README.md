This repository contains all the noise and artifacts surrounding the development of a new implementation of Meterpreter that is intended to run on the CLR. The entire project is being live streamed on [my Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/ojreeves), and archived on both [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/album/5934749) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYovnhafVaw-wGlLtQw1N0dHjxkkvc62o).

For the rationale behind this project, please see my [blog post](https://buffered.io/posts/new-livestream-series/), and check out Part 1 below.

This is going to take a long time, and at the moment there's not much to see!

## Pull Requests

I don't want to sound awful, but please don't submit any. At least not for a very long time. The point of the exercise is to build _everything_ live on stream, and the last thing I want to have happen is to have huge PRs submitted here only for me to reject them.

If you want to get involved with the coding, get in on the streams and participate that way. Thank you!
