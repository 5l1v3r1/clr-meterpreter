Which version should we use?
============================

* We are NOT going to use .NET 1.x -- it's too old.
* We can't target a single version and have it work everywhere.
* This means that we need to build multiple versions.
* CLR v2.0 and CLR 4 need to be supported
    - For 2.0 we'll use .NET Framework version ... ? (TBA)
    - For 4 we'll use .NET Framework 4.0
